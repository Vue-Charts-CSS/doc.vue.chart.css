# Roadmap

This page shows the future development roadmap of the wrapper.

## Long Term Roadmap

The wrapper should implement new features and components from the framework, when they drop. Not necessarily in this order, the long term goals are:

* **Bug Fixes** - Issues present on the tracker will receive ongoing support

* **More Chart types** - Add more chart types, start with radial and pie charts

* **More color support** - Improve existing support for colours

* **Better docs** - Extend docs with real-world examples

* **Build Tools** - Add more build tools.

* **Component (classes) Prefix** - Underlying framework wishes to add prefixing, this wrapper will need to provide support for this.

These goals are aligned with the underlying framework's goals.
