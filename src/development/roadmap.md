# Roadmap

This page shows the future development roadmap of the wrapper.

## Time Table

Planned Development:

* **April 2021** - Complete all chart types that already exist on underlying framework
    * Bar âœ…
    * Column âœ…
    * Area âŒ›
    * Line âŒ›

* **May 2021** - Apply performance enhancements and refactor code

* **June 2021** - Release Beta (begin testing)
    * This may change if the underlying framework has built more charts
    
* **July 2021** - Release v1.0.0 ðŸŽ‰

## Long Term Roadmap

The wrapper should implement new features and components from the framework. Not necessarily in this order, the long term goals are:

* **More Chart types** - Add more chart types, start with radial and pie charts. Waiting on **Charts.css**

* **More color support** - Improve existing support for colours

* **Better docs** - Extend docs with real-world examples

* **Build Tools** - Add more build tools.

* **Component (classes) Prefix** - Underlying framework wishes to add prefixing, this wrapper will need to provide support for this.
