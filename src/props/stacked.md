# Stacked

Stacked charts places the items either atop one another (column chart) or side-by-side (bar chart).

## Stacked Charts

Stacked charts are used to show how a larger group is divided into smaller groups and what the relationship of each part has on the total amount.

## Using Stacked Charts

By definition, stacked view can be applied only on multiple datasets. A single datasets has nothing to stack.

To change the display to stacked view simply use the `stacked` boolean prop.

```vue{3}
<charts-css
    ...
    stacked
/>
```
